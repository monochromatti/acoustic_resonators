  abstract = {A key issue in modern photonics is the ability to concentrate light into very small volumes, thus enhancing its interaction with quantum objects of sizes much smaller than the wavelength. In the microwave domain, for many years this task has been successfully performed by antennas, built from metals that can be considered almost perfect at these frequencies. Antenna-like concepts have been recently extended into the THz and up to the visible, however metal losses increase and limit their performances. In this work we experimentally study the light coupling properties of dense arrays of subwavelength THz antenna microcavities. We demonstrate that the combination of array layout with subwavelength electromagnetic confinement allows for 104-fold enhancement of the electromagnetic energy density inside the cavities, despite the low quality factor of a single element. This effect is quantitatively described by an analytical model that can be applied for the optimization of any nanoantenna array.},

We provide a detailed analysis of the physical mechanisms which give rise to these photonic modes.

  abstract = {Traditionally, strong-field physics explores phenomena in laser-driven matter (atoms, molecules, and solids) that cannot be understood by treating the laser field as a small perturbation. Therefore, the presence of an extremely strong external field is usually a prerequisite for observing strong-field phenomena. However, even in the complete absence of an external electromagnetic field, strong-field phenomena can arise when matter strongly couples with the zero-point field of the quantum vacuum state, i.e., fluctuating electromagnetic waves whose expectation value is zero. This can occur in free space where the matter strongly interacts with a continuum of photon modes, but some of the most striking examples of strong-field physics without an external field occur in a cavity setting, in which an ensemble of two-level atoms resonantly interacts with a single photonic mode of vacuum fields, producing vacuum Rabi splitting. In particular, the nature of the matter-vacuum-field coupled system fundamentally changes when the coupling rate (equal to one half of the vacuum Rabi splitting) becomes comparable to, or larger than, the resonance frequency. In this so-called ultrastrong coupling regime, a non-negligible number of photons exist in the ground state of the coupled system. Furthermore, the coupling rate can be cooperatively enhanced (via so-called Dicke cooperativity) when the matter is comprised of a large number of identical two-level particles, and a quantum phase transition is predicted to occur as the coupling rate reaches a critical value. Low-energy electronic or magnetic transitions in many-body condensed matter systems with large dipole moments are ideally suited for searching for these predicted phenomena. Here, we discuss two condensed matter systems that have shown cooperative ultrastrong interactions in the terahertz frequency range: a Landau-quantized two-dimensional electron gas interacting with high-quality-factor cavity photons, and an Er\textsuperscript{3+} spin ensemble interacting with Fe\textsuperscript{3+} magnons in ErFeO\textsubscript{3}.},

  abstract = {Cooperative quantum magnetism
One of the earliest and most intensively studied problems in quantum optics is the interaction of a two-level system (an atom) with a single photon. This simple system provides a rich platform for exploring exotic light-matter interactions and the emergence of more complex phenomena such as superradiance, which is a cooperative effect that emerges when the density of atoms is increased and coupling between them is enhanced. Going beyond the light-matter system, Li et al. observed analogous cooperative effects for coupled magnetic systems. The results suggest that ideas in quantum optics could be carried over and used to control and predict exotic phases in condensed matter systems.
Science, this issue p. 794
The interaction of N two-level atoms with a single-mode light field is an extensively studied many-body problem in quantum optics, first analyzed by Dicke in the context of superradiance. A characteristic of such systems is the cooperative enhancement of the coupling strength by a factor of N. In this study, we extended this cooperatively enhanced coupling to a solid-state system, demonstrating that it also occurs in a magnetic solid in the form of matter-matter interaction. Specifically, the exchange interaction of N paramagnetic erbium(III) (Er3+) spins with an iron(III) (Fe3+) magnon field in erbium orthoferrite (ErFeO3) exhibits a vacuum Rabi splitting whose magnitude is proportional to N. Our results provide a route for understanding, controlling, and predicting novel phases of condensed matter using concepts and tools available in quantum optics.
Cooperatively enhanced coupling, similar to that of light-matter interactions, is generalized to a coupled spin system.

  abstract = {This work is a threefold optical study of two perovskites: the very well known but still surprisingly intriguing SrTiO3 and its almost unexplored magnetic relative EuTiO3. A major extension to previous work is the very broad energy scale from the microwave to the ultra-violet region on which phenomena have been studied. Central in the thesis is the novel technique of time-domain spectroscopy in the THz range, a relatively unexplored range which clarifies and illustrates textbook phenomena of low energy physics. The thesis built up as follows. Chapter 1 introduces the theory of the interaction of light with matter and existing optical concepts needed in the following chapters. One part needs to be highlighted, it is a magnetic sum rule specially derived for the use in chapter 4, which relates the spectral weight of magnetic dipole transitions to the total magnetization of the system. Chapter 2 describes how SrTiO3 is tuned towards the formation of electron-phonon coupling by using chemical substitution of niobium as a control parameter. In chapter 3 it is shown that pristine SrTiO3 tuned by an external static electric field approaches a quantum ferroelectric state and shows an intriguing universal behavior below 20 K. Chapter 4 is devoted to influence of a magnetic field on the low energy optical properties of EuTiO3, which leads to a strong absorption due to the resonance of the electron spins, a so-called ferromagnetic spin resonance.},

The interaction between the electronic and phononic polarizations is treated perturbatively, and gives rise to stimulated emission of polartions in the case of inverted subbands. Our model provides a complete physical insight of the system and allows to determine the phonon and photon fraction of the laser gain. Moreover, it can be applied and extended to any type of designs and material systems, offering a wide set of possibilities for the optimization of future phonon-polariton lasers.},

Many of these problems "lead the student by the hand" to arrive at the results.

  doi = {10.1016/j.crhy.2016.05.001},
  abstract = {The physics of the interaction between a dense two-dimensional electron gas and a microcavity photonic mode is reviewed. For high electronic densities, this system enters the ultra-strong coupling regime in which the Rabi energy, which measures the strength of the light–matter coupling, is of the same order of magnitude as the matter excitation. The ultra-strong coupling has been experimentally demonstrated by inserting a highly doped semiconductor layer between two metal plates that produce a microcavity, with extreme sub-wavelength confinement of the electromagnetic field. A record value at room temperature (73\%) of the ratio between the Rabi and the matter excitation energies (the relative Rabi energy) has been measured together with a very large photonic gap induced by the polariton splitting. The ultra-strong coupling is a manifestation of a huge cooperative dipole, which is proportional to the number of electrons participating in the interaction. Such a phenomenal interaction with light appears also in the absence of a microcavity and, for a dipole coupled with free space, it gives rise to superradiance.
Résumé
Nous passons en revue la physique de l'interaction entre un gaz bidimensionnel d'électrons et un mode photonique de microcavité. Pour des densités électroniques suffisamment grandes, le système rentre dans le régime de couplage ultra-fort, dans lequel l'énergie de Rabi, qui mesure l'intensité du couplage lumière–matière, est du même ordre de grandeur que l'excitation dans la matière. Le couplage ultra-fort a été démontré expérimentalement en insérant un semiconducteur fortement dopé entre deux couches métalliques, qui forment une cavité avec un confinement très sub-longueur d'onde du champ électromagnétique. À température ambiante, une valeur record (73\%) du rapport entre l'énergie de Rabi et celle de l'éxcitation électronique (l'énergie de Rabi relative) a été mesurée, ainsi qu'une large bande interdite photonique induite par l'anticroisement entre les branches polaritoniques. Le couplage ultra-fort est une manifestation de l'existence d'un dipôle coopératif, proportionnel au nombre d'électrons qui participent à l'interaction avec la lumière. Ce très fort couplage apparaît aussi en l'absence d'une microcavité et, dans le cas d'un dipôle couplé à l'espace libre, donne lieu au phénomène de superradiance.},

  abstract = {Systems with a ferroelectric to paraelectric transition in the vicinity of room temperature are useful for devices. Adjusting the ferroelectric transition temperature (Tc) is traditionally accomplished by chemical substitution—as in BaxSr1-xTiO3, the material widely investigated for microwave devices in which the dielectric constant (εr) at GHz frequencies is tuned by applying a quasi-static electric field1,2. Heterogeneity associated with chemical substitution in such films, however, can broaden this phase transition by hundreds of degrees3, which is detrimental to tunability and microwave device performance. An alternative way to adjust Tc in ferroelectric films is strain4,5,6,7,8. Here we show that epitaxial strain from a newly developed substrate can be harnessed to increase Tc by hundreds of degrees and produce room-temperature ferroelectricity in strontium titanate, a material that is not normally ferroelectric at any temperature. This strain-induced enhancement in Tc is the largest ever reported. Spatially resolved images of the local polarization state reveal a uniformity that far exceeds films tailored by chemical substitution. The high εr at room temperature in these films (nearly 7,000 at 10\,GHz) and its sharp dependence on electric field are promising for device applications1,2.},

The predicted spontaneous polarization and the LO and TO phonon frequencies are found to be in good agreement with experiment. Anomalously large dynamical effective charges give rise to very strong mixing of the mode eigenvectors on going from the TO to the LO case, resulting in a ‘‘giant LO-TO splitting’’ in the sense that the soft TO mode is most closely related to the hardest LO modes. The results help explain the extreme sensitivity of these compounds to electrostatic boundary conditions.},

The dielectric behavior of these films is characterized by a rather low sample capacitance as compared to bulk single-crystal values and by occurrences of maxima in the capacitance-voltage and capacitance-temperature curves. The maximum attainable polarization was found to be 80 mC/m2 at 4.2 K. Complementary measurements on single crystals of SrTiO3 and SrTiO3:Nb reveal that the behavior of these SrTiO3 thin films can be understood from the bulk properties with additional strong charge trapping at the film-substrate interface.},
