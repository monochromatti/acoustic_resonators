# Overview of dataset

We use nanoscale acoustic confinement to excite coherent acoustic phonons (dynamical strain) with near-terahertz frequency, and demonstrate that such phonons can easily be excited when breaking the film-substrate epitaxy in the metallic perovskite SrRuO3. Moreover, thermal annealing of the free-standing membranes placed on a substrate with a similar lattice constant dramatically decreases the interfacial acoustic impedance mismatch, evidencing the reformation of chemical bonds and interfacial restructuring.

## Installation
Start by having `uv` installed. Then, download the data from [10.5281/zenodo.13220718](http://10.5281/zenodo.13220718/), using 

```shell
uv run data-download
```

To run any code in the project, you can create a virtual environment with `uv sync`, and activate with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
